# Blueprints

This directory is reserved for agent-generated blueprints.

- No stock/template blueprints are used by the orchestrator.
- `build_blueprint` requires a generated file path created by the blueprint design flow.
- Runtime output defaults to `BLUEPRINT_DIR` (for production: `/var/lib/mc-orchestrator/blueprints`).
